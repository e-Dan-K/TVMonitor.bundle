**Plex Plugin to monitor TV Shows in a better way than On-Deck**

On-Deck has many issues. For starters, it isn't available everywhere. But the biggest issue is it seems designed to help you continue watching shows you are already watching.
TVMonitor is designed to do more than that. It tracks shows you haven't started watching yet. It tracks shows that release new seasons years after the previous season (Hello, Arrested Development and Jessica Jones!).

To use, add at least one episode from each show you want to track to a playlist named "TVM". The Channel will display the TV Shows from that list that have new episodes, sorted by a variety of methods.

#### Features:
* This does work for multiple users on a single server, with each user needing their own playlist.

#### Compatibility Issues:
* Roku: Works!
* FireTV: Nope. Gets to the page with the show listed, but selecting it doesn't take you to the Show Page.
* Samsung TV: Nope. Gets to the page with the show listed, but selecting it doesn't take you to the Show Page.
* Others: Haven't been able to try.

#### Downsides:
* In general, playlist management on Plex isn't great, and usually can't be done on clients. This makes adding new shows more difficult than it would ideally be. If somehow the Playlist management could be brought into this app, and newly added TV Series could be disseminated to the users to add, it would be very helpful.

#### Version History:
v1.0: It works, but only on Roku.
